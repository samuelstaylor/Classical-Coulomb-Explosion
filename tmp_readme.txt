runtype 1:
run one singular simulation, 
should set: the seed and temperature in the control.inp

THESE RUN TYPES CAN BE PARALLELIZED:
runtype 2:
run several simulations, all with varying seeds in INCREMENTING ORDER

runtype 3:
run several simulations, all with varying seeds
include a path for seeds.inp with all the seeds to run each run from
